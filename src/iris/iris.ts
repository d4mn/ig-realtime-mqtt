 * The main purpose of the Iris.subscribe() is to send a point to the instagram server

 * It is useful if the connection was lost for a while
 * but you want to replay all the events fired in period you was disconnected.
 * To achieve it you need to cache seq_id - it's the sequential number indicating the point of the last handled event.
 *
 * For example - you handled event with seq_id 1.
 * Then you disconnected ror some reason for a 5 seconds and your friend wrote you 3 messages.
 * If after reconnecting you will subscribe using seq_id from DM http request - you wont get these messages.
 * Because DM http request always returns the current seq_id.
 * But if you cache seq_id 1 and send it instead of the http-fetched seq_id - instagram server will replay these 3 messages for you.
 *
 * Empirically, it was found out you can't send seq_id that is more than â‰ˆ115 points behind the current one.
 * Otherwise instagram will response with IrisQueueOverflowException
